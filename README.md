<h2 align="center">What is a PE file?</h2>

<h2 align="center">How can this project help me?</h2>

<h2 align="center">I want to see it working</h2>

<h2 align="center">I want to collaborate, how can I help?</h2>

<h2 align="center">Special thanks</h2>

<p align="center"> <a href="https://github.com/AkkoS2">AkkoS2</a> - For testing your RAW files and all support for testing during development.</p>
<p align="center"> <a href="https://github.com/Joao-Aschenbrenner">Joao-Aschenbrenner</a> - By taking care of the UI and all the image design, if you are looking for a good guy with UI he is the right choice.</p>
<p align="center">And thanks to the documentation and works of other people explaining every detail of the PE header that certainly improved my understanding a lot, no one built knowledge alone!</p>
